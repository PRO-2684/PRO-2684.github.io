# üóìÔ∏è Timeline
## 2022
### 3.21
Created this project.

### 3.22 ~ 3.24
Not documented.

### 3.24
1. Switch from hash `#` navigation to pjax like navigation, which takes advantage of url query strings and `pushState` method.
2. Display metadata.
3. Convert Notable `@note/xxx` link to `?page=xxx`, remove their `target` and `rel` attributes, and add `onclick` function as below. In this way, if the user clicks the note link directly, `load` will be invoked instead of refreshing or openning a new tab, while right click and middle click works just as fine.

    ```javascript
    nodes[i].onclick = function (e) {
        load(filename);
        e.preventDefault();
    }
    ```

### 3.25
1. Fix the behavior of reloading when hash changes.
2. Smooth anchor positioning.
3. Use `highlight.js` for syntax highlighting.

### 3.26
1. Fix the behavior of reloading when hash changes(bug reappeared, dunno why).
2. Fix the bug where hash argument disappeares after refreshing; Also add an `anchor_header` id for navigating to the top smoothly.
3. Store markdown content in `state`, so you don't have to request for it every time you go back or forward.
4. If no title set in metadata, document title is set to `<filename>.md - PRO's blog`; If error occured, document title is set to `<errcode> <errtext> - PRO's blog`.
5. Add link to markdown source code.
6. Better time display. (`2022-03-26T15:02:28.619Z` to `2022-03-26 15:02:28`)
7. More output during requests.

### 3.27
1. Border radius for `code` tags.
2. Change scrollbar style. (mostly from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/))
