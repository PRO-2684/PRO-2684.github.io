# RTL Lab

## Explanation

The Unicode characters `U+202E` and `U+202D` are used to change the text direction of a string. The `U+202E` character is used to change the text direction to RTL (Right-To-Left) and the `U+202D` character is used to change the text direction to LTR (Left-To-Right). Thus, the `U+202E` character is called `RLO` (Right-To-Left Override) and the `U+202D` character is called `LRO` (Left-To-Right Override).
